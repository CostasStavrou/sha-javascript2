    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This week we have 2 exercises.</p>
    <div id="exercise1">
      <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index.html">Step 1</a></h2>
      <p>Write a function that takes 4 arguments.
      <ul>
        <li>A start value</li>
        <li>An end value</li>
        <li>A callback to call if the number is divisible by 3</li>
        <li>A callback to call if the number is divisible by 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The function should generate an array containing values from start
      value to end value (inclusive).<br>
      Then the function should loop over the array and call the third argument
      if the array value is divisible by 3<br>
      The function should call the fourth argument if the array value is
      divisible by 5<br>
      Both functions should be called if the array value is divisible by
      both 3 and 5</p>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index2.html">Step 2</a></h2>
      Please solve
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/repeat-a-string-repeat-a-string">
      this problem</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Solve the problem using a for loop</li>
        <li>Solve the problem using a while loop</li>
        <li>Solve the problem using a do loop</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index3.html">Step 3</a></h2>
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/construct-javascript-objects-with-functions">
      Some practice</a> with objects
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index4.html">Step 4</a></h2>
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/nesting-for-loops">Nested loops</a>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index5.html">Step 5</a></h2>
      <p>We did some work with arrays -
      <span style="font-family: monospace">var arr = [1,2,3]</span>
      We can also nest arrays inside arrays like this
      <span style="font-family: monospace">var arr2d = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]</span>
      (for math people you can think of this as a matrix) How would you
      print all the items of an array with 3 dimensions? How about
      with K dimensions? What if you didn't know how deep the array was
      nested? (You don't have to write code for this but think about it)</p>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index6.html">Step 6</a></h2>
      <p>Here are two functions that look like they do the something similar but
      they print different results. Please explain what's going on here.</p>
      <pre>
      var x = 9;
      function f1(val) {
          val = val+1;
          return val;
      }
      f1(x);
      console.log(x);


      var y = { x: 9 };
      function f2(val) {
          val.x = val.x + 1;
          return val;
      }
      f2(y);
      console.log(y);
      </pre>
      <p>If you are confused please run the code and then consult
      the Google for "javaScript pass by value pass by reference"</p>
    </div>
