    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This week we have 2 exercises.</p>
    <div id="exercise1">
      <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index.html">Step 1</a></h2>
      <p>Write a function that takes 4 arguments.
      <ul>
        <li>A start value</li>
        <li>An end value</li>
        <li>A callback to call if the number is divisible by 3</li>
        <li>A callback to call if the number is divisible by 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The function should generate an array containing values from start
      value to end value (inclusive).<br>
      Then the function should loop over the array and call the third argument
      if the array value is divisible by 3<br>
      The function should call the fourth argument if the array value is
      divisible by 5<br>
      Both functions should be called if the array value is divisible by
      both 3 and 5</p>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index2.html">Step 2</a></h2>
      Please solve
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/repeat-a-string-repeat-a-string">
      this problem</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Solve the problem using a for loop</li>
        <li>Solve the problem using a while loop</li>
        <li>Solve the problem using a do loop</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index3.html">Step 3</a></h2>
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/construct-javascript-objects-with-functions">
      Some practice</a> with objects
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index4.html">Step 4</a></h2>
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/nesting-for-loops">Nested loops</a>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index5.html">Step 5</a></h2>
      <p>We did some work with arrays -
      <span style="font-family: monospace">var arr = [1,2,3]</span>
      We can also nest arrays inside arrays like this
      <span style="font-family: monospace">var arr2d = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]</span>
      (for math people you can think of this as a matrix) How would you
      print all the items of an array with 3 dimensions? How about
      with K dimensions? What if you didn't know how deep the array was
      nested? (You don't have to write code for this but think about it)</p>
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index6.html">Step 6</a></h2>
      <p>Here are two functions that look like they do the something similar but
      they print different results. Please explain what's going on here.</p>
      <pre>
      var x = 9;
      function f1(val) {
          val = val+1;
          return val;
      }
      f1(x);
      console.log(x);


      var y = { x: 9 };
      function f2(val) {
          val.x = val.x + 1;
          return val;
      }
      f2(y);
      console.log(y);
      </pre>
      <p>If you are confused please run the code and then consult
      the Google for "javaScript pass by value pass by reference"</p>
    </div>
    <div id="exercise2">
      <h2><a a href="./exercise2/index.html">Exercise 2</a></h2>
      <p>Make a website that fetches (= to get) data asynchronously.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new website with external js file</li>
        <li>Add a button (e.g. 'click me') that when clicked
          <span style="font-family:monospace">console.logs</span>
          'you clicked me!'</li>
        <li>Create a function that fetches from The
          <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github API</a>. For example from
          [<a href="https://api.github.com/orgs/SocialHackersCodeSchool/repos">this page</a>]
          (the one we used last week). For help on this check this
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/247483/http-get-request-in-javascript">SO post</a>
        </li>
        <li>Display the data that you get from the Github API on your web page.</li>
        <li>Now link the two together: When you click the button -> get the data
          from the Github API and display it on your website</li>
        <li>Make all the repositories link their own page in Github. Use the value
          of the key: name to make this work (hint: Github urls always look like this
          <a href="https://api.github.com/repos/SocialHackersCodeSchool/%5BrepositoryName%5D">https://api.github.com/repos/SocialHackersCodeSchool/[repositoryName]</a>
          where [repositoryName] would be replaced by the actual name of the repository,
          for example CommandLine). Make sure the link opens in a new tab.</li>
        <li>BONUS: if you look at this:
          <pre>https://api.github.com/repos/SocialHackersCodeSchool/CommandLine</pre>
          You can see CommandLine in the URL. These are called "query parameters" and
          let us specify in detail what we want from the API. Play around with this.
          For example you can make two buttons that either get data for a specific
          repository, JavaScript or Node.js. Or go even more crazy and make users
          type in a search box 'JavaScript' and then send that to the API by changing
          the repository.</li>
      </ol>
