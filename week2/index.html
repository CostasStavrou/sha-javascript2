    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This week we have 2 exercises.</p>
    <div id="exercise1">
      <h2><a href="./exercise1/index.html">Exercise 1</a></h2>
      <p>Write a function that takes 4 arguments.
      <ul>
        <li>A start value</li>
        <li>An end value</li>
        <li>A callback to call if the number is divisible by 3</li>
        <li>A callback to call if the number is divisible by 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The function should generate an array containing values from start
      value to end value (inclusive).<br>
      Then the function should loop over the array and call the third argument
      if the array value is divisible by 3<br>
      The function should call the fourth argument if the array value is
      divisible by 5<br>
      Both functions should be called if the array value is divisible by
      both 3 and 5</p>
    </div>
