    <p>f1 has a local variable named val and takes as argument x, which
    is a number literal equal to 9. It changes the local copy so when we return
    the outer x has it's original value. In second case, f2 gets passed an
    object, meaning a copy with address in memory of the object (what we call
    a reference to the object) is kept in local variable val. Then we use This
    reference to change the object in memory. So we change the object itself.
